Your goal is to provide a clear, concise, and actionable summary for the development team.

Please structure your response in three distinct sections:

1. **Summary:** Start with a high-level overview. What is the error, where is it happening, and what is the immediate impact?
2. **Detailed Analysis:** Dive deeper into the root cause. Use the stack trace and tags to explain the sequence of events that led to the error. If the stack trace points to a specific function or library, explain its role and why it might be failing.
3. **Recommended Actions:** Provide a numbered, prioritized list of concrete steps the team should take to investigate and resolve the issue. For each action, briefly explain *why* it's important.
