## Overview

This document explains how to integrate the IO.NET intelligence LLM model with the [PocketFlow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow) codebase document generator, inspired by the [PocketFlow-Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow-Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge) project.

By leveraging PocketFlow's AI-powered documentation tools, you can automatically generate high-quality, beginner-friendly documentation for your codebase. These documents provide a clear representation of your code structure, abstractions, and workflows, making it easier for both new and experienced developers to understand complex systems.

## Key Features

- **Automated Codebase Analysis:** Crawl and analyze your repository to extract core abstractions and relationships.
- **LLM-Powered Documentation:** Use IO.NET's LLM to generate readable, insightful tutorials and code explanations.
- **Code RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Index generated documents as code RAG, enabling advanced search and contextual retrieval for engineering teams.
- **Enhanced Context for Senior Engineers:** Provide rich, indexed documentation that accelerates onboarding, code reviews, and architectural decision-making.

## How It Works

1. **Connect IO.NET LLM:** Integrate your IO.NET intelligence LLM model as the backend for code analysis and document generation.
2. **Run PocketFlow Generator:** Use the PocketFlow scripts to crawl your codebase and produce markdown tutorials and visualizations.
3. **Index as Code RAG:** Store the generated documents in a retrieval-augmented system to provide context-aware assistance for developers.

## Example Use Cases

- **Onboarding:** New team members can quickly understand project structure and logic through AI-generated tutorials.
- **Code Reviews:** Senior engineers can reference indexed documentation for deeper context during reviews.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Maintain up-to-date, accessible documentation as your codebase evolves.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Set up your IO.NET LLM credentials in the configuration file.
3. Run the PocketFlow document generator:
   ```bash
   python main.py --dir /path/to/your/codebase --include "*.py" --exclude "*test*"
   ```
4. Index the generated markdown files for code RAG.
