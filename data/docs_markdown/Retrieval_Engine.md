# Retrieval Engine
The **Retrieval Engine** is a powerful tool within the io.net ecosystem that enhances your AI applications with capabilities like document ingestion, intelligent file management, agentic reasoning, and conversational question answering.
Retrieval Engine allows your AI to **read, view** , and **listen** to various types of content â€” learning from them in real-time. Once your files are ingested, Retrieval Engine combines the insights and context from your documents to generate intelligent, grounded responses to your queries.
### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/retrieval-engine#what-is-retrieval-engine)
[Retrieval Engine](https://ai.io.net/ai/re) stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** â€” a method of combining a language model with a retrieval system. Instead of relying solely on the language model's pre-trained knowledge, Retrieval Engine retrieves relevant context from your uploaded documents in real-time to answer your questions more accurately and specifically.
Itâ€™s especially useful in enterprise, research, and developer environments where accuracy, transparency, and traceability of answers are critical.
### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/retrieval-engine#getting-started)
To begin using the Retrieval Engine System:
  1. **Go to your io.net Dashboard.**
  2. Navigate to the **[Retrieval Engine](https://ai.io.net/ai/re)** into **IO Intelligence** section.
  3. Upload your content and begin interacting with the system.

Main Settings
  * **Vector Search** â€“ Uses machine learning to find semantically similar content, even if exact keywords arenâ€™t used.
  * **Hybrid Search** â€“ Combines both traditional keyword search and semantic (vector-based) search for more accurate results.
  * **Graph Search** â€“ Enhances retrieval using relationships and connections between documents or data points.

**Vector Search Settings**
  * **Search Results Limit** â€“ Number of results shown per query (default is 10).
  * **Index Measure** â€“ Method for comparing similarity: 
    * **Cosine** â€“ Measures angle between vectors (commonly used).
    * **Euclidean** â€“ Measures straight-line distance.
    * **Dot Product** â€“ Multiplies and sums vector elements.
  * **Probes** â€“ Controls the number of partitions searched; more probes = better recall, but slower performance.
  * **EF Search** â€“ Trade-off setting between speed and accuracy during search. Higher = better results but slower.

**Hybrid Search Settings**
  * **Full Text Weight** â€“ Sets how much importance to give exact keyword matches.
  * **Semantic Weight** â€“ Sets how much importance to give AI-based understanding of the text.
  * **Full Text Limit** â€“ Limits how many keyword-based results to include in hybrid search.
  * **RRF K** â€“ A ranking method that merges results from different search strategies. Higher K = more balanced merging.

**RAG Generation Settings (RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
  * **Model** â€“ Selects which AI model to use for generating responses.
  * **Temperature** â€“ Controls randomness of the AIâ€™s responses: 
    * Lower (e.g. 0.1) = more focused and deterministic answers.
  * **Top P** â€“ Controls diversity. 1 = full range of outputs considered.
  * **Max Tokens to Sample** â€“ Limits how long the AIâ€™s response can be (1024 tokens = about 700â€“800 words).
