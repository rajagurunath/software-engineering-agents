# Run Jobs on Clusters
IO Cloud users can run jobs on their clusters using Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook.
Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized various fields by enabling data-driven decision-making and automating complex tasks. As ML models become more sophisticated, the computational power required to train and deploy these models increases significantly. Running machine learning jobs on clusters, which consist of interconnected computers working together, has become a critical approach to meet these demands. This document provides an overview of the benefits, setup, and best practices for running machine learning jobs on clusters, ensuring efficient and scalable ML workflows.

  1. **Enhanced Computational Power**  
Clusters aggregate the computational resources of multiple machines, providing the necessary power to handle large-scale ML tasks. This enables the training of complex models on vast datasets that would be infeasible on a single machine.
  2. **Scalability**  
Clusters offer the ability to scale resources up or down based on the needs of the ML job. This flexibility allows for efficient resource management and cost optimization, ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately for different stages of the ML workflow.
  3. **Parallel Processing**  
By distributing tasks across multiple nodes in a cluster, ML jobs can be executed in parallel, significantly reducing the time required for training and inference. This parallelism is crucial for handling the iterative and computationally intensive nature of ML algorithms.
  4. **Fault Tolerance and Reliability**  
Clusters are designed with fault tolerance in mind. In the event of hardware failure or other issues, the workload can be redistributed among other nodes, minimizing downtime and ensuring the reliability of ML job execution.
