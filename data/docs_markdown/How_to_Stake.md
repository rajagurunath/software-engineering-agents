  3. Select your crypto wallet in the pop-up window. Please note that this wallet can be different from the wallet you have associated with your account. For example, see [Solana Wallet](https://docs.io.net/docs/solana) to learn more.

Now that your crypto wallet is connected, you are ready to stake $IO.. 
  1. Locate the worker you want to stake to and click the **Stake** button under **Staking Actions** in the **Manage Your Stake & Devices** table.

  1. In the pop-up window, enter the required amount of $IO for your hardware, and confirm by clicking the **Stake** button. Remember that you can always add to your $IO stake later, but you must use the same wallet that you originally used to stake on that device.

> You can unstake at any time, and an Unstake option will be available for each device youâ€™ve staked. Bear in mind that once you unstake, you will need to wait for a 14-day cooldown period before the stake can be withdrawn. Stake in cooldown does not count towards the staking requirement for devices to receive Block Rewards.

This smart contract address is a unique identifier where the $IO staking contract is deployed:
```
https://solscan.io/account/8tvkkogztREitU38YBxZDmirRiarcm5vNaCV2P2pFArz 

```

#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/staking#security)
Solscan allows you to explore and view data stored on the Solana blockchain. You can use this to verify the smart contract address you are interacting with against the official address provided in our documentation. This ensures you are engaging with the legitimate contract.
You can also review the total amount of $IO staked on the blockchain. You can confirm the staked amounts and verify that info matches your expectations.
Read the suggestions below to enhance the security of your stake:
  * Manually enter io.net into your URL to stake and bookmark it. Don't search for io.net to avoid imposter websites. Sites such as [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/whois) offer domain lookups. Most imposter sites are active for a very short period of time. 
  * Do not click on links from unverified sources. Beware of strangers approaching you on social media about crypto opportunities. 
  * Be aware of phishing websites and fake contracts that attempt to mimic our staking platform. If something seems suspicious, verify the information with our resources or contact our support team.
  * Always use a secure wallet and consider hardware wallets for added security. Be cautious of any prompts that ask for your private keys or seed phrases. We won't ask for this information.
