# Manage Clusters
Manage Clusters offers a comprehensive interface for configuring and monitoring GPU and CPU clusters, enabling users to optimize resource allocation and performance. With advanced management tools, users can efficiently deploy workloads, scale resources, and gain real-time insights into cluster health and utilization.
To access the dashboard, log into io.net and select **Manager Clusters**.

The **Clusters** tab provides a quick overview of all your clusters, both active and inactive.
#### 
Sort Clusters
[](https://docs.io.net/docs/monitor-manage-clusters-copy#span-stylecolor-whitesort-clustersspan)
Use the sorting options to find the cluster you're looking for easily. Sort by status (**Running, Completed, Failed, Destroyed**) or search by keyword.

#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/monitor-manage-clusters-copy#actions)
A completed cluster provides the option to archive the cluster. Click **Archive** in the bottom right to archive this cluster.
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/monitor-manage-clusters-copy#run-jobs-and-monitor-your-cluster)
Ready to start working on your cluster? You can run your jobs using either Visual Studio or Jupyter Notebook. The Ray Dashboard lets you manage and monitor everything, including your cluster and running jobs.
On your cluster's details page, grab the **IDE Password** , and then click on **Jupyter Notebook** , **Visual Studio** , or the **Ray Dashboard** to get started.

To access your application, enter the **IDE Password**.
> ## ðŸš§
> Once your cluster's time expires, you'll lose access to the IDEs and the Ray Dashboard.
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/monitor-manage-clusters-copy#archive-a-cluster)
Once a cluster is complete, you can archive it. Click **Archive** at the bottom right to archive a cluster.
> ## ðŸš§
> You canâ€™t renew a cluster after itâ€™s completed.

Action
Definition
Compute Hours
Shows how long a single instance has been running and consuming resources. For detailed tracking, see **Served** and **Remaining** times, which display the exact time the cluster has been running along with start/end dates.
Funds Used or Refunded
Notes the funds used or refunded for cluster operations.
Connectivity Tier
Indicates your chosen connectivity level for the cluster, showing download and upload speeds.
Security Compliance
Displays your selected security setting. For example, **End-to-End** encryption ensures data is encrypted and accessible only to intended recipients.
Locations
Shows where your GPUs are located for your cluster.

Action
Definition
All Workers
Allows you to filter the view by selecting different groups of workers. This option is currently set to show all workers in the cluster.
[#] Workers
Indicates that the dashboard currently shows four workers in the cluster that are active or relevant to the task being monitored. The panel below labels these workers as "IO Worker 1," "IO Worker 2," and so on.
[#] GPUs
Shows that there are 4 GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) in use across the cluster. Each worker seems to have one GPU assigned to it, as indicated by the details in each worker's panel.
Search
The search bar allows you to quickly find specific workers, GPUs, or tasks by searching based on keywords, worker names, device IDs, or other identifiers.

Feature
Description
Decentralized Network
IO Cloud uses a network of computers (called "IO workers") to create powerful GPU clusters. This means you're not relying on a single company for your computing power.
Self-healing
If one part of the cluster has issues, the others automatically take over, keeping your projects running smoothly.
Easy to Use
You can easily run your AI projects using Python code, just like on any other cloud platform.
Built on Industry-leading Technology
IO Cloud is powered by the same technology used by OpenAI to train its powerful AI models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4.

Feature
Description
Worker Name and Status
Indicates the worker's status, such as Completed, Running, Pending, or Failed. A green dot signifies successful completion.
Device ID
The unique identifier for the specific GPU device in the worker node.
GPU Information
**GeForce RTX 3060 Ti** (GPU type): Each worker is equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GPU.  
**x1** : Indicates the number of GPUs utilized (in this case, one unit of GeForce RTX 3060 Ti).  
**Uptime in Cluster** : Displays each worker's uptime in the cluster, showing it has been fully operational without downtime for the monitored period. 
Activity Consistency Status Bar
A visual representation of the workerâ€™s uptime, consisting of 10 white squares filled in to indicate 100% uptime.
