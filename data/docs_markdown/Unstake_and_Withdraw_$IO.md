You can unstake at any time. An Unstake option is available for every device you stake. Once you unstake, you are subject to a 14-day cooldown period before the stake can be withdrawn. If a stake is in cooldown period, it does't meet the staking requirement for Block Rewards.
Follow the instructions below to unstake $IO:
  1. Go to io.net > **IO Worker** > **Staking** tab. 
  2. Locate the stake that you want to unstake. Click **Unstake** under the **Action** column.

  1. A pop-up window appears, informing you that the entire amount must be unstaked & that it no longer counts toward the Minimum Required Stake for Block Rewards.  
Click the **Unstake** button.

  1. After you **Unstake** , a timer appears next to the worker, counting down the 14-day cooldown period. You can't withdraw your funds until this period of time elapses.

You can only withdraw funds to the wallet used for the initial stake. If you attempt to withdraw to a different wallet, you will receive a warning message. To stake with a new wallet, please unstake and withdraw your funds first.

If you use the same wallet, you're prompted to withdraw funds to it. When you click the **Withdraw** button, your wallet extension will open to **Confirm** the transaction.
