# IO Tokenomics
Tokenomics defines the structure and mechanics of a token, covering aspects like distribution, supply-demand dynamics, utility, incentives, governance, and value capture. This document provides transparency into the tokenomics of io.net.

### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-tokenomics#fixed-maximum-supply)
The total supply of $IO is capped at 800 million coins.
  * 500 million $IO will be distributed at launch.
  * The remaining 300 million $IO will be emitted as hourly rewards to Suppliers and their Stakers over time.


### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-tokenomics#hourly-rewards)
Rewards are distributed hourly to Suppliers and their Stakers over 20 years following a disinflationary model:
  * Starts at 8% annual inflation in year 1.
  * Decreases by 1.02% monthly (~12% per year) until the cap of 800 million $IO is reached.


Charts detail the emission rates, annual inflation, and the distribution of emitted vs. remaining coins.

### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-tokenomics#burn-mechanism)
$IO employs a programmatic coin burn system:
  * Revenues from the IOG Network are used to purchase and burn $IO.
  * The burn amount is adjusted dynamically based on $IO's price, reducing supply and creating deflationary pressure.

## [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-tokenomics#revenue-streams-and-fee-structure)
io.net generates revenue through fees charged to both Users (Renters) and Suppliers:
**GPU Renter Fees**
  * Reservation Fee: 
    * 0.25% of the total compute reservation cost is added to the Renter's cost.
  * Payment Fee: 
    * 2% fee for payments made in 100% USDC.
    * No fees for payments made in 100% $IO.


**GPU Supplier Fees**
  * Reservation Fee: 
    * 0.25% fee on the total reservation cost, charged to the Supplier upon payment for compute.
  * Payment Fee: 
    * 2% fee for payments in 100% USDC.
    * No fees for payments in 100% $IO.

  * **Fixed Supply:** Capped at 800 million $IO.
  * **Hourly Rewards:** Emitted to Suppliers and Stakers over 20 years with decreasing inflation.
  * **Burn Mechanism:** Reduces supply via programmatic burns funded by network revenue.


These mechanisms ensure a balanced and sustainable ecosystem for $IO.
