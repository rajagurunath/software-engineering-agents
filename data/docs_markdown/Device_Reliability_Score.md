# Device Reliability Score
The **Device Reliability Score** is a key metric that helps both **worker providers** and **co-stakers** assess the reliability and trustworthiness of a device in the staking network. It reflects how consistently the device performs and whether it meets IO.net’s technical and uptime requirements.

Your **Device Reliability Score** directly impacts your ability to attract co-stakers. A higher score indicates a more reliable device, making it more appealing for co-stakers who want to ensure their contributions are secure and productive.

  1. **Maintain Consistent Uptime:** Devices that experience frequent downtime or technical issues are penalized. Ensure your device is always running and connected to the network as much as possible.
  2. **Meet Staking Requirements:** Consistently meet the minimum staking requirements to avoid slashing or penalties. Slashing or unstaking for failure to meet requirements directly impacts your score.
  3. **Device Performance:** Devices with higher computational power (e.g., newer GPUs, faster CPUs) tend to have a better reliability score. Optimize your hardware for better performance.
  4. **Network Stability** : Ensure that your internet connection is stable and fast. Devices that frequently disconnect or experience network instability will receive a lower reliability score.
  5. **Monitor & Optimize Regularly**: Regularly check your device’s performance metrics and optimize it as necessary, whether that’s upgrading hardware or troubleshooting any recurring issues.

As a **co-staker** , the **Device Reliability Score** allows you to evaluate the likelihood that your contribution will remain stable and continue to earn rewards without disruptions. Devices with higher scores are less likely to face slashing penalties or fail to meet staking requirements.

  1. **Filter by Reliability:** In the **Co-Staking Marketplace** , you can filter offers based on the **Device Reliability Score**. This helps you sort and prioritize staking offers that come from more reliable devices.

  2. **Evaluate the Risk:** A device with a **low reliability score** might be riskier for your investment. Be sure to assess whether the offered reward percentage justifies the risk.

  3. **Understand the Impact on Rewards:** A lower reliability score may increase the risk of slashing or other penalties, meaning you could lose part of your staked funds. Devices with high reliability are less likely to experience slashing.

The **Device Reliability Score** is determined based on several factors, including:
  * **Device Uptime:** Percentage of time the device is online and active.
  * **Performance Metrics** : Hardware capabilities and performance consistency.
  * **Network Stability** : Frequency of disconnections or network failures.
  * **Slashing Events** : Past penalties for failing to meet staking requirements.
  * **Historical Compliance** : Whether the device owner consistently meets the staking thresholds.


A **higher score** indicates a better-performing, more reliable device, making it more attractive for both workers to stake on and co-stakers to contribute funds.

  * **For Worker Providers:** Higher reliability scores help attract more co-stakers, increasing the likelihood of filling staking offers.
  * **For Co-Stakers:** By sorting devices based on reliability, you can reduce the risk of staking your funds on a device prone to penalties, disconnections, or performance issues.
