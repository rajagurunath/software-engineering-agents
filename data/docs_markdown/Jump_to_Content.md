### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/block-rewards#what-are-block-rewards)
Block rewards are payments made to suppliers who provide their GPUs or CPUs to our network. This incentivizes supply-side network growth. These rewards are accrued hourly in $IO, following a predefined emission schedule. Rewards are potentially subject to slashing before distribution.
### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/block-rewards#block-rewards-allocation)
Block Rewards are credited to Suppliers on an hourly basis for making their GPU or CPU available on the IOG Network, thereby incentivizing supply-side network growth. This payout is in IO Coin and follows a predetermined emission schedule. The current allocation of block rewards from each hourly emission is:
  * 95% to GPUs
  * 5% to CPUs


The ratio of rewards may be adjusted in the future to manage network growth.

#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/block-rewards#initial-block-reward)
**The first Block Reward was created on June 25th 2024 12:00 UTC.** We will calculate and publish the initial block rewards. Block rewards use a claim mechanism that is similar to the Ignition Program. The first 7 days of block reward were claimable together with S3 of Ignition Reward. Block Rewards for June 25th - June 30th will be claimable.

> IO Device Level Staking / Minimum staking is now required for Block Rewards. To learn more about staking, see [IO Staking](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-staking).
IOG Foundation provides emission rewards to incentivize the correct growth of the IO ecosystem. To better align with Ignition Reward Season 3, the IOG Foundation hasnâ€™t requested IO.net Inc. to cap the amount of devices eligible for block rewards. In the future, the IOG Foundation will monitor the reward distribution and may potentially cap the amount of devices eligible for the top percentage of nodes. A device cap would be used to increase the alignment of the network's structure.
### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/block-rewards#block-reward-nomination-requirements)
The requirements below must be met to be nominated for a Block Reward:
  * Device **Uptime** must be green for the past 5 hours.
  * The minimum stake for the device must be met. To learn more about staking, see [IO Staking](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-staking). 
  * The account holder for the device must have a valid Solana wallet.
  * The deviceâ€™s status is **not** terminated or unsupported.
  * The deviceâ€™s hardware multiplier is greater than 0. 
  * The deviceâ€™s connectivity tier is greater than 0.


> ## ðŸ“˜
> When a block is about to close, we test your device for Uptime and PoW again.

Click the caret to the right of the status, **Eligible** in screenshot below, to open the **Block Rewards Nomination Checklist**. Each step of the verification status is displayed, with a green or red check that indicates success or failure. The checklist displays the **current status** of the device's eligibility for a block reward. In the screenshot below, if a new block was opening, this device would be eligible. 
The **Block Rewards Nomination Checklist** is designed to offer total transparency into the Block Reward nomination process.

#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/block-rewards#device-limitations)
  * M3 devices with 8GB memory can be configured by users for higher memory. The minimum configuration should be 16GB of memory.
  * As of July, 5th, we removed Block Reward eligibility for Threadrippers. This is due to reports that malicious actors tried to inject Ryzen Threadripper devices into Block Rewards. We will reevaluate this and restore this option in the future. 


### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/block-rewards#wallets)
Wallets with Exchange Deposit Addresses (Custodial wallets) are not supported. To collect Block Rewards, worker earnings, or seasonal events, connect a Web3 wallet (Self-Custodial wallet) in your Account Settings. Exchange Deposit Addresses are not supported because airdrop claims require a smart contract interaction.
> ## ðŸš§
> We do not support Exchange Deposit Addresses (Custodial wallets) for Block Rewards. If you connect a wallet with an Exchange Deposit Address to your account in Account Settings, you wonâ€™t be able to claim Block Rewards, seasonal events, nor worker earnings. If this is the case, please change it to a Self-Custodial wallet ASAP.
