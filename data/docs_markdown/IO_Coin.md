# IO Coin
What is IO Coin ($IO)?
IO Coin ($IO) is the native cryptocurrency of the IOG Network, powering its ecosystem and facilitating seamless interactions between key participants. These participants include:
### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#gpu-renters-users)
Machine Learning Engineers, developers, and individual consumers who use $IO to rent GPU computing power for tasks like deploying GPU clusters, running cloud gaming instances, or building applications such as Unreal Engine 5 pixel streaming. Users can also leverage $IO for serverless AI model inferences via platforms like BC8.ai and other apps hosted on io.net.
### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#gpu-owners-suppliers)
Independent data centers, crypto mining farms, and professional miners supply underutilized GPU computing power to the network. They earn $IO tokens by providing this compute power.
### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#io-coin-holders-community)
Supporters who stake $IO to secure the network, earn rewards and align incentives across the ecosystem for sustainable growth and adoption.
These roles are flexible—anyone can participate in multiple capacities (e.g., a GPU owner can also be an $IO holder and a GPU renter).

### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#universal-payment-system)
The IOG Network’s payment system revolves around $IO. While users can pay in fiat (e.g., USD), USDC, or other supported cryptocurrencies, all payments are ultimately converted to $IO behind the scenes. This approach reduces friction in transactions and avoids traditional issues like escrow and delayed billing, while maintaining strong demand for $IO.

  * Customers can pay in USDC or fiat for GPU services.
  * Suppliers receive compensation in $IO, creating demand for the token.


#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#supplier-options)
  * Suppliers can opt to receive payments in native $IO or convert earnings into USDC, based on their preference.

### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#fee-structure-incentivizing-io-use)
The network’s fee model encourages the use of $IO for transactions while charging minimal fees for critical operations like staking and rewards.
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#user-fees)
  * Payments in USDC: 2% facilitation fee.
  * Payments in $IO: No fee.


#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#supplier-fees)
  * Rewards earned through network emissions: No fee.
  * Compute job earnings: 
    * Payments in USDC: 2% fee.
    * Payments in $IO: No fee.


This fee structure ensures that $IO remains the most cost-effective way to transact on the network.

### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#network-security-and-collateralization)
$IO is integral to securing and maintaining the network’s integrity. Two primary mechanisms achieve this:
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#node-collateral-requirements)
A minimum amount of $IO must be staked to operate a node and earn idle rewards.
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#staking-for-rewards)
Additional $IO can be staked up to a maximum limit per node, allowing holders to earn rewards while contributing to the network’s security and reliability.
These mechanisms incentivize active participation and align interests across the network.

### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/io-coin#why-io-matters)
$IO is more than just a transactional token—it’s the backbone of the IOG Network, driving economic activity and ensuring network health. Its design creates a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem that benefits Renters, Suppliers, and Holders alike.
By reducing payment friction, offering a flexible fee structure, and integrating network security features, $IO builds a sustainable framework for growth and innovation.
