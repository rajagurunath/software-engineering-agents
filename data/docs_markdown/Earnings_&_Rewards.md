### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/earnings-rewards#job-payments)
**Important** : If the job is completed within a day, **payment is made immediately**. For jobs that last multiple days, **payment is made at the end of each day**.  
A few points:
  * If your Worker participated in a job and remained available throughout, it **will receive payment**.
  * If the Worker was **unavailable** during the cluster process, it **will not receive payment for the whole time**.
  * If the Worker **stops within the first hour** of connection, **no payment will be made for that time**.


You can search for a transaction by entering the Job ID number and filter transactions by date within any permitted period. Clicking on a specific transaction will open a page with detailed information about it.
