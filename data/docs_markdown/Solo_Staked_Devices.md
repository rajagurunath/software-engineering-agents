To stake on IO, you need to connect your crypto wallet.
  1. Go to io.net > **IO Worker** > **Staking** tab. 
  2. Follow the steps in [ Rewards and Wallets](https://docs.io.net/docs/rewards-wallets) to connect your wallet. 


> ## 📘
> Staking above the minimum required stake does not increase block rewards.
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/solo-staked-devices#stake-io)
Once you’ve connected your wallet, you can stake $IO to your device. After you connect your device to our network, you must stake to the device.
To view your devices that have no stake or only a stake from the device owner, click the **Solo Staked Devices** tab. The screenshot below shows a **list of devices** , indicating whether they have no stake, or just the owner’s stake.

> ## 📘
> Before making a co-staking offer, a full stake must be created for your device.
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/solo-staked-devices#stake-your-tokens)
  1. Locate your device and click **Stake** in the **Staking Actions** column.

  2. In the pop-up window, enter the required **$IO amount** to stake your device, then click **Stake**. Any subsequent solo staking attempts on the same worker must use the wallet that was initially used for the device’s stake.

## [](https://docs.io.net/docs/solo-staked-devices#14-day-cooldown-period)
The **14-day cooldown period** is important when unstaking your funds. Here's how it works:
  * You can **unstake** at any time, but there is a **14-day cooldown period** before the funds can be fully withdrawn.
  * **Funds in cooldown** are**not counted toward staking requirements.**
  * During the cooldown, your funds remain locked and cannot be withdrawn until the process is complete.


> ## ❗️
> During the cooldown period, your funds do not contribute to staking rewards. You will only be able to access your funds after the 14-day period ends.
