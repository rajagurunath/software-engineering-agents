# Deleting, Unstaking & Withdrawing
Co-Staking operates as a smart contract on the blockchain, allowing device owners to invite co-stakers to contribute to their stake in exchange for a share of block rewards.

  * If you unstake part of your contribution while co-staked, you are **not** subject to a cooldown period.
  * If a co-staker cancels their stake, you have **7 days** to cover the remaining portion or create a new co-staking offer.
  * During this **7-day period** , your device continues fulfilling staking requirements for block reward eligibility.

**If you unstake first:**
  * If your stake remains above the minimum requirement, there is no impact.
  * If your stake **falls below the requirement** , the system automatically unstakes for the co-staker. In this case, all funds enter the **14-day cooldown period**.

You can cancel a stake at any time.
  * **Unstaking takes 14 days.**
  * You must **unstake the entire amount** , which stops counting toward the **Minimum Required Stake** immediately.
  * You **cannot** restake until the process is complete.
  * Unstaking **is not available** for devices in **hired status.**

Overflow refers to funds exceeding your initial stake that can be withdrawn separately, while your original stake remains locked until the unstaking process is complete.
**How to Withdraw Overflow:**
  1. Go to the **Manage Your Stake & Devices** section and select the **Co-Staked Devices** tab.
  2. Find your device, click the ellipsis, and select **Withdraw Overflow** from the dropdown menu.
