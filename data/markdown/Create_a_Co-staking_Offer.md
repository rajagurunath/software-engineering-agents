# Create a Co-staking Offer
Co-Staking operates as a smart contract on the blockchain, allowing device owners to invite co-stakers to contribute to their stake in exchange for a share of block rewards.

Before creating a Co-Staking offer, ensure that your device meets the **minimum staking requirement**. If the requirement is not met, the option to create a Co-Staking offer will be disabled (grayed out).
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/create-a-co-staking-offer#steps-to-create-a-co-staking-offer)
  1. In the **Staking Actions** column, click the three dots next to your device and select **Create Co-Staking Offer.**

  2. Set the amount of IO you’re requesting from a potential co-staker using the slider on the **Co-Staker Contribution** page. _The maximum co-stake is 50% of the total stake._

  3. On the **Block Reward Sharing** page, define the reward percentage for the co-staker using the slider. In the screenshot below, the co-staker will receive 74% of the block reward.  
Below the slider, we provide the estimated block reward per block for your co-staker based on the previous 7-day average.

Track your Co-Staking offer in the **Co-Staking** Devices tab. Statuses include:
  * **Sufficient State (Wait Period):** The co-staker has unstaked, and their contribution is in the 7-day **Wait Period**. The stake still counts toward the device’s minimum staking requirement but does not earn block rewards.
  * **Sufficient State (Waiting for Co-Staker):** The owner has staked the device and is awaiting a co-staker.
  * **In Cooldown:** The unstaking process has completed the wait period and is now in a **14-day cooldown** , where funds remain locked.
  * **Co-Staker Withdrawn:** The co-staker has successfully withdrawn their funds after completing the unstaking process.
  * **Co-Staker Unstaked (In Wait Period):** The co-staker has initiated unstaking, and their funds are in the **7-day wait period.**
  * **Offer Closed:** The offer has been closed by the owner or due to other circumstances and is no longer available in the marketplace.
  * **Insufficient Stake (Waiting for Co-Staker):** The device does not meet the minimum stake requirement and is waiting for a co-staker to fulfill it.
