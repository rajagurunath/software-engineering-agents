# Collaborative Staking (Co-Staking)
In the world of decentralized networks, staking is a crucial way to secure blockchain systems and reward participants. **Collaborative Staking (Co-Staking)** takes this idea further by allowing third parties to participate in staking on devices they don't own, earning a share of the block rewards. This makes staking more accessible and encourages a more inclusive and cooperative network.
On our platform, **Co-Staking** allows users to contribute to staking on someone elseâ€™s device. This creates a partnership where both the device owner and the co-staker benefit. However, itâ€™s important to remember that if a device doesn't meet the platformâ€™s requirements, it could be penalized (a process called **slashing**), which may reduce both rewards and the original staked amount.
This guide will walk you through how to find staking opportunities, manage your co-staked devices, and track your rewards. Whether you're experienced with staking or just getting started, weâ€™ll provide the tools and knowledge you need to navigate the Co-Staking system with confidence.

> To ensure that more users can benefit from co-staking offers, we have set a claim cap of up to **two offers** per IO account.

## [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#faqs)
We've compiled answers to frequently asked questions about co-staking on io.net, including troubleshooting tips and guidelines to help users navigate the platform.
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#getting-started-with-co-staking)
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-why-is-the-create-co-staking-offer-button-greyed-out-for-my-device)
If you're a device owner and the **"Create Co-Staking Offer"** button is greyed out, it likely means your device hasnâ€™t met the minimum self-staking requirement. io.net requires you to stake a certain amount of **$IO tokens** on the device before inviting co-stakers. In most cases, you must stake **at least 50%** of the total required amount before creating an offer.
Ensure that:
  * Your device is fully set up and active on the network.
  * You have met the minimum staking requirement.


Co-staking is only available for operational devices.
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-can-a-person-co-stake-on-multiple-devices)
**Yes** , co-stakers can participate in multiple devices simultaneously. However, you can **only claim offers from two devices at any given time**. This ensures fair distribution and prevents one person from monopolizing multiple co-staking opportunities.
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-can-i-co-stake-on-my-own-device)
**No** , device owners **cannot co-stake on their own devices**. This rule is in place to prevent users from bypassing staking requirements, such as the**minimum self-staking threshold**. Co-staking is designed to foster collaboration between independent parties.
> ## ðŸ“˜
> Unstaking involves a 7-day waiting period followed by a 14-day cooldown period. Funds cannot be used during the cooldown, and rewards are paused during this time.

##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-how-many-co-stakers-can-a-device-have)
Each device can have **only one co-staker per offer.** Co-staking agreements follow a **one-to-one structure** :
  * **1 device owner â†’ 1 co-staker**


If a device owner needs more than one co-staker, they must create multiple offers or reduce their own stake. **Co-stakers can participate in up to two devices at the same time.**
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-are-the-identities-of-co-stakers-or-device-owners-visible)
No, identities are **anonymized** within the marketplace. While users can view **device specifications and staking terms** , personal details of device owners or co-stakers are not disclosed.
However, **wallet addresses are visible on the blockchain** , but they do not directly reveal the identity of the parties involved.
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-can-i-change-the-terms-of-a-co-staking-agreement-after-it-has-been-accepted)
**No** , once a co-staking offer is accepted, its terms are **locked in via a smart contract**. You **cannot modify** the stake amount, reward split, or other conditions after activation.
If changes are needed, you must:
  1. **Cancel or close** the existing offer.
  2. **Create a new** offer with the updated terms.

  

#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#withdrawing--unstaking)
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-how-do-i-unstake-and-withdraw-funds-from-co-staking)
To withdraw your staked funds:
  1. Click "**Unstake** " - this initiates a **7-day waiting period** where your tokens stop earning rewards.
  2. After the waiting period, your stake enters a **14-day cooldown period**.
  3. Once the cooldown ends, your tokens will be available for withdrawal.

  

#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#risks--performance-considerations)
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-what-if-the-device-i-co-staked-on-performs-poorly-or-goes-offline)
io.net has a **slashing mechanism** that penalizes underperforming devices. If a device frequently goes offline or fails to meet performance requirements, **both the device owner's and co-staker's stake may be slashed**.
> ## ðŸ“˜
> Slashing means forfeiting part of the staked amount as a penalty.
To minimize risk, always **select reliable devices** before co-staking.
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-how-does-co-staking-compare-to-traditional-staking)
Unlike traditional staking, where tokens are delegated to validators, **co-staking on io.net directly stakes tokens onto a specific device.**
Key differences:
  * Co-stakers share the risk of slashing.
  * Rewards and conditions are set in a **smart contract.**
  * It promotes a **collaborative staking model** rather than simple delegation.

##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/3rd-party-staking#q-what-should-i-do-if-i-experience-an-issue-not-covered-in-the-faqs)
If you encounter a problem, such as:
  * A **transaction error**
  * A **device not appearing in the marketplace**
  * **Co-staking issues**


Try the following:
  * Ensure youâ€™re using the **official io.net platform**.
  * Verify that your **wallet is properly connected**.
  * **Clear your browser cache** or try a **different browser**.


If the issue persists, reach out to **io.net support** through:
