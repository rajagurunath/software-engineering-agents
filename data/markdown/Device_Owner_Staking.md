Whether you're staking on your own or teaming up with others through **co-staking** , this guide will walk you through everything —from connecting your wallet to managing your stakes and maximizing your rewards.

##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/device-owner-staking#q-can-a-person-co-stake-on-multiple-devices)
Yes.
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/device-owner-staking#q-is-there-a-limitation)
As the device owner, you can not co-stake with your own devices.
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/device-owner-staking#q-what-is-the-maximum-number-of-co-staking-offers-i-can-claim)
To ensure that more users can benefit from co-staking offers, we have set a claim cap of up to**two offers per IO account.**
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/device-owner-staking#identity--anonymity)
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/device-owner-staking#q-are-there-any-identifiable-details-of-a-co-staker-or-device-owner)
No, the marketplace deliberately anonymizes this information for privacy. However, wallet details remain public on the blockchain.
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/device-owner-staking#q-what-if-a-co-staker-and-device-owner-want-to-adjust-contributions)
If the co-staking offer is still not being taken up, the device owner can simply cancel the offer and create a new one. Otherwise, they must unstake and wait for the cooldown period to pass before creating a new one.

##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/device-owner-staking#q-can-multiple-co-stakers-contribute-to-a-single-offer)
No. Only one co-staker is allowed per offer.
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/device-owner-staking#q-if-a-primary-worker-is-suspected-of-fraud-or-gets-slashed-what-happens-financially-to-the-co-staker)
If BR (Block Rewards) are slashed, co-stakers are also impacted.
##### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/device-owner-staking#q-what-happens-to-the-co-staked-io-when-the-device-owner-terminates-the-device)
The device will immediately stop earning Block Rewards for both the supplier and co-staker as the device no longer meets the requirement for earning Block Rewards. Staked $IO will not be automatically unstaked and will need to be manually unstaked and go through the applicable Wait Period and/or Cooldown period.
