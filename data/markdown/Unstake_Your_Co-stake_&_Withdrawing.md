You can cancel a stake at any time. If a co-staker unstakes first, an additional **7-day wait period** is added to the **14-day cooldown** , making the stake unavailable for **21 days**.
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/unstake-your-co-stake#partial-unstaking-of-overflow-solo-stakers)
Solo stakers can also partially unstake their excess (overflow) amount without deactivating the worker.
  * **Overflow** is calculated as:  
`(Your Stake + Co-stake) â€“ Minimum Stake Requirement`
  * You can withdraw this overflow at any time by: 
    * Using the **Withdraw Overflow** button (if visible), or
    * Selecting **Unstake** and entering an amount equal to or less than the overflow.


> ## ðŸš§
> If you enter more than the overflow amount, the system will treat it as a full unstake and deactivate the device.
#### [](https://docs.io.net/docs/unstake-your-co-stake#important-notes)
  * Unstaking may be **blocked** if: 
    * The device is currently **rented in a cluster**
    * The offer is **open** and unstaking would reduce the total stake below the required minimum


There is **no penalty** or impact on the device status when withdrawing only the overflow amount.
