# Deploy Bare Metal On Demand Cluster
Ideal for your most demanding workloads, use Bare Metal clusters to unlock unparalleled performance with direct access to hardware resources. Deliver lower latency, higher efficiency, and maintain complete control over your system configuration.
The Bare Metal Automated Solution provides fast, self-service access to dedicated hardware resources, all of which eliminate delays from custom contracts and manual setup. This solution is ideal for high-performance workloads such as AI model training, making predictions (inferencing), and other compute-heavy tasks. Through an automated deployment flow, you can select and provision devices in minutes, while our real-time dashboard offers visibility into usage, performance metrics, and costs to optimize your deployments.
> ## ðŸ“˜
> Access Restriction
> Bare Metal On-Demand clusters do not provide `sudo` or `root` access.  
>  Certain system-level operations requiring elevated privileges will not be possible. Please ensure your workloads and deployment requirements can operate within this restriction.
