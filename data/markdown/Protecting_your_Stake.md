# Protecting your Stake
**How to Ensure Strengthened Security for Your Stake**
When participating in $IO staking, it’s crucial to only interact with the official and correct smart contract. This contract governs the staking process, ensuring your funds are safely managed in line with the platform's operations. To protect yourself from potential risks, always verify the contract address before making any transactions. Here’s how you can safeguard your funds and ensure the legitimacy of your transactions.

> We will never DM you in Discord or any other platform outside our official channels with alternative wallet addresses.
Be cautious of scammers who may ask you to transfer funds to alternative addresses. If you receive any unsolicited messages asking you to send crypto to another wallet or join a staking offer outside of official channels, **do not engage**. Scammers often impersonate our team, and many users have fallen victim to these attacks, resulting in lost funds. Protect your assets by following the steps outlined below.

  * **Access URLs Directly:** Always type **io.net** directly into your browser and bookmark the site. This protects against phishing sites that could trick you into entering personal details on fraudulent websites.
  * **Verify Smart Contracts:** Before interacting with any smart contract, use trusted tools like **Solscan** to confirm the contract address matches the one provided in our official documentation. This step helps ensure your interactions are with legitimate addresses only.
  * **Watch Out for Phishing:** Be cautious of links from unverified sources, unsolicited crypto offers, or direct messages, especially on platforms like Discord, social media, or community forums. Scammers often impersonate official channels and offer fake staking opportunities or ask you to send funds to alternative wallet addresses.
  * **Use Secure Wallets:** For added security, use **hardware wallets** to store your funds. These provide an extra layer of protection against hacks. Never share your **private keys** or **seed phrases** with anyone, and always store them securely.
